# UniversalSort
A universal sorting algorithm using polymorphism I wrote in C in preparation of a final.

### Usage
All input should be of the form ./universal_sort <function> <size> [element 1] [element 2] [element 3]... where <function> is a sorting function from the list below. <size> is the size of each element in bytes.

### Sorting Functions
Right now, there is only one function (compare_int). In the future, there may be more.

##### compare_int
This simply compares ints, and will order them from lowest to highest when used in UniversalSort.
